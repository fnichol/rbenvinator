{"name":"rbenvinator","body":"## <a name=\"prerequisites\"></a> Pre-Requisites\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"prerequisites-vagrant\"></a> Vagrant\r\n\r\nYou need to have an up-to-date version of [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)\r\ninstalled on your system.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"prerequisites-vagrant-base-boxes\"></a> Vagrant Base Boxes\r\n\r\nAfter Vagrant is installed you must add the base boxes you want to use. If\r\nyou need to create a base box then refer to the Vagrant documentation or the\r\n[VeeWee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee/) project for more details.\r\n\r\nI also maintain a collection of\r\n[VeeWee definitions](https://github.com/fnichol/veewee-definitions) that I use\r\nwith this project.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"prerequisites-librarian-gem\"></a> Librarian Gem\r\n\r\nThe [Librarian](http://rubygems.org/gems/librarian) also needs to be installed\r\nby running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ gem install librarian\r\n```\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"prerequisites-s3\"></a> An AWS/S3 Account\r\n\r\nrbenvinator will upload the tarball packages artifacts as they are built to\r\nS3 for hosting. You will need:\r\n\r\n* Your access key id\r\n* Your secret access key\r\n* An S3 bucket created for uploading\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"setup\"></a> Setup\r\n\r\nFirst, clone down the project:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/fnichol/rbenvinator.git\r\n$ cd rbenvinator\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext initialize your configuration with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ rake init\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow edit the `config.yml` and fill in your AWS/S3 credentials and enumerate\r\nthe Vagrant base box/Ruby version combinations you want to build against.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"build\"></a> Build Them All!\r\n\r\nNow run through each base box (one at a time) and compile all your Ruby\r\nversions! Maybe this'll be the last time...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ time (rake build)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"development\"></a> Development\r\n\r\n* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\r\n* Report issues/questions/feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\r\n\r\nPull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested.\r\nIdeally create a topic branch for every separate change you make. For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n1. Fork the repo\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"authors\"></a> Authors\r\n\r\nCreated and maintained by [Fletcher Nichol][fnichol] (<fnichol@nichol.ca>)\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"license\"></a> License\r\n\r\nMIT (see [LICENSE][license])\r\n\r\n[license]:      https://github.com/fnichol/rbenvinator/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n[fnichol]:      https://github.com/fnichol\r\n[repo]:         https://github.com/fnichol/rbenvinator\r\n[issues]:       https://github.com/fnichol/rbenvinator/issues\r\n[contributors]: https://github.com/fnichol/rbenvinator/contributors\r\n","tagline":"Building Ruby version tarballs for rbenv.
